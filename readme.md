# _{Todo App}_

#### By: _**{Khaled Sarhan}**_

## Description

_Todo app for managing tasks_

## Technologies Used

- _React_
- _Typescript_
- _Redux toolkit_
- _React-beautiful-dnd_
- _Axios_
- _React query_
- _React toastify_
- _Vite_
- _React-hook-form_

## notes:

- Login password validation removed cuz of BE limitaion (static email and password).
- It would be great if I write conventional commit messages.
- Groups image is static cuz it's not sent from BE
- some functionalities would be great if it were implemented like:
  - Signout
  - Notifications
  - Edit Tasks
  - Search
  - Dark mode, cuz why not!
